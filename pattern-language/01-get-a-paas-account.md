# 1 Register to use GOV.UK PaaS

## Problem

You are developing a service and think that the [GOV.UK PaaS][1] may provide hosting and developer tooling.

You want to get access to the system so you can evaluate is usefulness as quickly as possible.

## Solution

Speak to your team and wider organisation to see if the platform is already being used.

If you can identify an organisation manager they should be able to advise you or event grant you access to the system directly.

If you need to request access you should complete the form at

> https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/signup




and the team will be able to advise and help set you up.

You will receive email instuctions explaining how to log in and use the platform.

## Discussion

The sign up journey for the platform assumes a degree of knowledge you may not have about usage in your department.

If you are in GDS you are encouraged to talk to the team using the GDS Slack [#paas][3] channel and they will advise.

If you are in the public sector and have access to cross government slack you can talk to the team at [#govuk-paas][4]

If you cannot access Slack you can use the [support][3] form to ask questions.
