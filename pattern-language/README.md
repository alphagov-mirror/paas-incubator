# GOV.UK PaaS Pattern Language

> A pattern language for [GOV.UK PaaS]

## Introduction

[GOV.UK PaaS] has a good level of lower level developer documentation in the [GOV.UK PaaS tech docs] however it is not always easy for a user of the platform to figure out how to do things or to make use of the platform.

This [pattern language] brings together some of the more commonly encountered patterns and to show how they can be used and to reference examples where tenants have implemented the patterns.

It is a practical reference to the various ways the PaaS can be used to solve problems. Patterns can be reused and combined in different combinations.

## Language structure

The elements of the language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem occurs over and over again and then describes the core of a solution to that problem.

The patterns all follow a common format based on a [template](pattern-template.md). This approached is heavily influenced by Christopher Alexander's book [A Pattern Language]

| part | decription |

Each pattern may be connected to other patterns and together they comprise the pattern language.
