# GOV.UK PaaS pattern book

> A book of patterns for usage of [GOV.UK PaaS]

The PaaS has a good level of developer documentation in the [GOV.UK PaaS tech docs] however it is not always easy for a user of the platform to figure out how to do things or to make use of the platform.

This book is intended to bring together some of the more commonly encountered patterns and to show how they can be used and to reference examples where tenenants have implemented the patterns.

The pattern approach seems appropriate given the nature of the platform
